── Chapter 1 PURPOSE ────────────────────────────────────────

── ((1) 1 of 1) Introduction ────────────────────────────────
We will use the computer not to further burden the accepted
curriculum, but to provide the teacher with a simple general
aide to help in the teaching of it.

This help includes such things as evaluating results of
exercises; showing graphs and collections of graphs; and
coloring multiplication and other function tables to
emphasize the patterns that occur in them.

── Chapter 2 FUNCTION TABLES ────────────────────────────────

── ((2) 1 of 5) Bare and Bordered Tables ────────────────────
In the following examples we will use NB. (Nota Bene) to
append comments -- which are not treated as part of the
preceding expression. For example:
)
   + table 1 2 3 4 5 NB. An addition table (with arguments)

── ((2) 2 of 5) Bare and Bordered Tables (ctd) ──────────────
 The arguments included in the
 addition table make it easy
 to interpret, but the bare
 table makes it easier to
 concentrate on the relations
 between the sums.

 We now show the use of color
 to emphasize these relations.

 Press the key
 Esc to remove
 the color window
 so that you may
 proceed to the
 next panel.

   color + bare 1 2 3 4 5 NB. Color equal values alike

── ((2) 3 of 5) Experiments ─────────────────────────────────
To experiment with this facility, type the following
expressions, pressing the Enter key to execute each of them:

   - table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

   color - bare 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 - 4

   * table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 - 4

   color * bare 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 - 4
)

── ((2) 4 of 5) Experiments (ctd) ───────────────────────────
In the preceding panel you could have avoided typing (and
mistyping) the entries by using the up-arrow key to move the
cursor up to an expression, pressing enter to bring it down
to the "input area" (where it may be modified by typing and
by using the left and right arrows and the delete key), and
again pressing Enter to execute it. Try this on the
following:

   i:4 NB. A list of integers from _4 to 4

   color * bare i:4

   < table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7      NB. A comparison table

   color < bare 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 NB. Esc removes color window

   = table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

   color = bare 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

You may also use the Up Arrow or Page Up to review earlier
panels, and Down Arrow or Page Down to move back down.

To begin at the beginning of any chapter, click on Studio,
then on Chapters (in the dropped menu), then on the desired
chapter.

── Chapter 3 GRAMMAR ────────────────────────────────────────

── ((3) 1 of 2) Mathematics as a Language ───────────────────
Although the notation of mathematics is commonly recognized
as a language, it is not common to examine its grammar.
Nevertheless, it can be helpful to explore some analogies
with English -- in the expression sin(1.57), the function sin
performs an action upon the number 1.57, analogous to the
action of a verb upon a noun.

Moreover, in the expression + table 1 2 3 4 5, table modifies
the verb + to produce a related verb. It is therefore
analogous to an adverb.

This simple notion of modifying a verb to produce a related
verb (fruitful in both math and English) is often made
difficult by introducing it very late, commonly in the
treatment of differential equations, where it is called an
operator (or Heaviside operator).

Finally, the assignment of a name to a noun (as in Let x=3),
is analogous to the introduction of a pronoun. To call this
name a "variable" can be misleading, especially in a case
such as Let pi=3.1416, where its value is clearly not
intended to vary.
)

── ((3) 2 of 2) Assignment and Equality ─────────────────────
In math, the distinction between the COMPARISON pi=3.1416,
and the ASSIGNMENT of the value 3.1416 to the name pi, is
made by writing Let pi=3.1416 for the latter. Programming
languages simply use a similar symbol, and no Let -- (we will
use =: and refer to it by the proper English term "copula").
For example:
)
   x=:3 NB. The copula =: assigns a value to the pronoun x
   x < 4
1
   x<1 2 3 4 5 6
0 0 0 1 1 1
   x=1 2 3 4 5 6 NB. Equality comparison
0 0 1 0 0 0
   x=:5          NB. Assigns a new value to the pronoun
   x=1 2 3 4 5 6 NB. Comparison using the new value
0 0 0 0 1 0
   
   x=: i: 3
   color * bare x

── Chapter 4 LITERAL ARGUMENTS ──────────────────────────────

── ((4) 1 of 5) Relations ───────────────────────────────────
It is commonly assumed that mathematics is about numbers. So
it is, but it would be more accurate to say that math is
about relations, and that relations are observable as
patterns -- matters emphasized in the foregoing uses of
numbers and tables of numbers. To emphasize this point
further we will introduce non-numeric arguments called
literals.

We may say that MAY is the sister of AMY, but we say that
'MAY' is an anagram of 'AMY', using quotes to indicate that
we are speaking about two three-letter words, not about two
girls. In the following examples we will apply the anagram
function A. to various words:
)
   1 A. 'AMY' NB. An anagram, but not an English word or name
AYM
   0 1 2 3 4 5 A. 'AMY' NB. All six anagrams of 'AMY'
AMY
AYM
MAY
MYA
YAM
YMA
   color 0 1 2 3 4 5 A. 'AMY'

── ((4) 2 of 5) Number of Anagrams ──────────────────────────
The foregoing color window illustrated why there are exactly
3*2*1 distinct anagrams (permutations) of a list of three
elements. We may therefore expect to see 4*3*2*1 (factorial
4) anagrams of a four-letter word.

(Click the middle button of the color window to alternately
maximize and minimize its size.)
)
   !4   NB. Factorial 4 (4*3*2*1)
24
   
   i.!4 NB. 24 integers beginning at 0
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
   
   color (i.!4)A. 'OPST'

── ((4) 3 of 5) Permutations ────────────────────────────────
Having made the point of using non-numeric arguments to
explore relations, we may now remark that the anagram
function applies to lists of numbers as well as to lists of
literals.

Anagrams of numeric lists are commonly called permutations:
)
   (i.!4)A.1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 4 3
1 3 2 4
1 3 4 2
1 4 2 3
1 4 3 2
2 1 3 4
2 1 4 3
2 3 1 4

4 2 1 3
4 2 3 1
4 3 1 2
4 3 2 1
   
   color (i.!4)A.1 2 3 4

── ((4) 4 of 5) Orientations of Tables ──────────────────────
The table (i.!4)A.1 2 3 4 may be more readable if "flipped on
its diagonal" to show the rows as columns. We provide three
functions which together provide all possible orientations of
a table:
)
   t1=:- bare 1 2 3
   t1
0 _1 _2
1  0 _1
2  1  0
   fod t1 NB. Flip on diagonal (- is non-commutative)
 0  1 2
_1  0 1
_2 _1 0
   foh t1 NB. Flip on horizontal axis
2  1  0
1  0 _1
0 _1 _2
   fov t1 NB. Flip on vertical axis
_2 _1 0
_1  0 1
 0  1 2

── ((4) 5 of 5) Selection and Subscripts ────────────────────
Subscripts are commonly used to index lists and tables. We
will use the function sub as illustrated below -- it uses
indices beginning at 0 rather than at 1:
)
   x=:2 3 5 7 11
   x sub 0
2
   x sub 2 4
5 11
   
   t1 sub 1             NB. Select row
1 0 _1
   (fod t1) sub 1       NB. Select column
_1 0 1
   
   fod (fod t1) sub 2 0 NB. Select columns
_2 0
_1 1
 0 2

── Chapter 5 PLOTS ──────────────────────────────────────────

── ((5) 1 of 8) Bare and Lined Plots ────────────────────────
Graphs (or plots) are an effective way to display the results
of a function. To use a grid x1 for plotting sin x1, we will
write plot x1 for sin x1, as illustrated below:
)
   x1=:0.5*i:7
   x1
_3.5 _3 _2.5 _2 _1.5 _1 _0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5
   plot x1 for sin x1

── ((5) 2 of 8) Bare and Lined Plots (ctd) ──────────────────
Finer grids may also be used. Moreover, the alternative
function PLOT adds vertical lines from each point:
)
   x2=:0.1*i:30
   
   PLOT x2 for sin x2
   
   NB. The names x1 and x2 will be used repeatedly,
   NB. and you should not assign new values to them.

── ((5) 3 of 8) Multiple Plots ──────────────────────────────
Several curves can be plotted together in various ways. For
example, fod x1 + bare 0 1 2 3 gives a table which, when its
sines are plotted, shows sines displaced in phase:
)
   fod x1 + bare 0 1 2 3 NB. "flip on diagonal" (also called "transpose")
_3.5 _3 _2.5 _2 _1.5 _1 _0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5
_2.5 _2 _1.5 _1 _0.5  0  0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5
_1.5 _1 _0.5  0  0.5  1  1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5
_0.5  0  0.5  1  1.5  2  2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 6 6.5
   
   plot x1 for sin fod x1 + bare 0 1 2 3

── ((5) 4 of 8) Multiple Plots (ctd) ────────────────────────
Curves may also be plotted together in the manner illustrated
below:
)
   >(sin x1);(cos x1);(cos x1+0.2)

   plot x1 for >(sin x1);(cos x1);(cos x1+0.2)

── ((5) 5 of 8) Plots Against Other Than the Grid ───────────
The expression plot x2 for sin x2 may be said to plot sin x2
"against" x2. Since sin x2 is normally plotted against x2, it
appears unnecessary to include "x2 for" in the expression.
However, sin x2 can also be plotted against other functions
to produce unusual results:
)
   plot (cos x2) for (sin x2)

── ((5) 6 of 8) Plots Against Other Than the Grid (ctd) ─────
The result is a circle (as indicated by the scales on the
plot) even though it might appear to be an ellipse. This
appearance can be modified by clicking on the lower edge of
the plot and holding the mouse button to drag it up or down.

Incidentally, the entire graph can be moved out of the way of
text by similarly clicking on the top bar.
)

── ((5) 7 of 8) Plots Against Other Than the Grid (ctd) ─────
Try any other interesting cases known from mathematics. For
example:
)
   plot (sin x2) for (sin 2*x2)

── ((5) 8 of 8) Surface Plots ───────────────────────────────
Corresponding points of a collection of curves can be joined
together to form a surface. For example:
)
   'surface' plot sin x1 + bare 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

── Chapter 6 PUZZLES ────────────────────────────────────────

── ((6) 1 of 16) Puzzle 1 ───────────────────────────────────
Certain puzzling things that occur in mathematics are due, at
least in part, to the notation used. We will discuss a few
examples.

1. In high school algebra, why do we not use mnemonic names
and abbreviations such as age and wgt, rather than limiting
ourselves to single letters such as x and y?

The answer is that we ruled out multi-letter names by
adopting the "convenient" abbreviation xy for the product of
x and y -- denoted by x*y in most programming languages. In
other words, age would be interpreted as a*g*e, and pi as
p*i.

Since the work is limited to single-letter names, students
may miss the important fact that algebra introduces into
mathematics the use of NAMES, rather than the use of LETTERS.
)

── ((6) 2 of 16) Puzzle 1 (ctd) ─────────────────────────────
Moreover, if x and y have the values 3 and 4, then it should
be possible to write 34 or 3y or x3 for the product of x and
y given by the case xy. Only the case 3y would be understood
as the intended product.

The important principle of the substitutability of equivalent
values in mathematical expressions is therefore contravened
by the convention concerning xy.
)

── ((6) 3 of 16) Puzzle 2 ───────────────────────────────────
2. Because a*(b+c) is equivalent to (a*b)+(a*c), we say that
multiplication "distributes" over addition.

Because * is "commutative" [that is, its result remains
unchanged if its arguments are interchanged, or "commuted"],
(b+c)*a is also equivalent to (a*b)+(a*c). We will test these
assertions by assigning values to the three names:
)
   a=:2
   b=:3
   c=:5
   
   a*(b+c)
16
   (a*b)+(a*c)
16
   
   (b+c)*a
16
   (b*a)+(c*a)
16

── ((6) 4 of 16) Puzzle 2 (ctd) ─────────────────────────────
Using % to denote "divided by", we will explore the question
of whether division distributes over addition:
)
   a%(b+c)
0.25
   (a%b)+(a%c)
1.06667
   
   (b+c)%a
4
   (b%a)+(c%a)
4

── ((6) 5 of 16) Puzzle 2 (ctd) ─────────────────────────────
The first identity fails, but the second does not. This is
sometimes addressed by saying that "division distributes to
the left, but not to the right".

More precisely, we may say that "divide and a right argument
a" is a function of one argument (written as %&a, and read
aloud as "divide and a" or "divide with a") that distributes
over addition, but that the function a&% does not. For
example:
)
   %&a (b+c)
4
   
   (%&a b)+(%&a c)
4
   
   g=: a&% NB. Assign a name to the other case
   
   g (b+c)
0.25
   
   (g b)+(g c)
1.06667

── ((6) 6 of 16) Puzzle 2 (ctd) ─────────────────────────────
From this it appears clearer to speak of the distributivity
of a monadic function (one applied to a single argument) such
as %&a, than of the distributivity of the dyadic function
from which it may be derived.

In particular, we may say that a linear function is one that
distributes over addition -- a statement that presents a
strong reason for the importance of linear functions.
)

── ((6) 7 of 16) Puzzle 3 ───────────────────────────────────
3. If a list of five numbers is partitioned by taking the
first three and dropping the first three, then the sums of
the parts may be added to give the same result as the sum
over the original list. For example:
)
   x=:1 2 3 4 5
   3 take x
1 2 3
   sum 3 take x
6
   
   3 drop x
4 5
   sum 3 drop x
9
   
   (sum 3 take x)+(sum 3 drop x)
15
   sum x
15
   (sum 0 take x)+(sum 0 drop x)
15

── ((6) 8 of 16) Puzzle 3 (ctd) ─────────────────────────────
The final example used 0 to partition x into an empty list
and the entire list, raising the question of what meaning
should be ascribed to the sum over an empty list.

Not surprisingly, the result must be 0, because 0 is the
"identity element" of addition, that is, a number which added
to any x gives x An identity element of a function is also
called its "neutral".

We will now explore the corresponding case of multiplication:
)
   (prod 3 take x)*(prod 3 drop x)
120
   prod x
120
   (prod 0 take x)*(prod 0 drop x)
120
   
   prod 0 take x
1

── ((6) 9 of 16) Puzzle 3 (ctd) ─────────────────────────────
In this case, the product over the empty list is not 0, but 1
-- the neutral of multiplication.

This very useful inclusion and treatment of empty lists is
not commonly made in mathematical notation.

Experiment with the dyadic function min and its monadic
counterpart minof to find the neutral of the minimum
function. In particular, test whether it indeed behaves as a
neutral.
)

── ((6) 10 of 16) Puzzle 3 (ctd) ────────────────────────────
The experiments concerning the identity element of minimum
suggest that it might be used as the DEFINITION of infinity
(denoted here by _).
)

── ((6) 11 of 16) Puzzle 4 ──────────────────────────────────
4. Need for the treatment of empty lists arises in many ways.
For example, a binomial coefficient (commonly denoted by an n
above a k with enclosing parentheses, and denoted here by
k!n) is commonly defined by a fraction with a denominator of
k factors -- that is: k(k-1)...(1).

But what is to be made of the case k=:0, that is, a product
over an empty list? The needed result is of course 1, as
developed in the foregoing panels.
)
   n=:4
   k=:2
   k!n

   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ! 4

── ((6) 13 of 16) Puzzle 5 ──────────────────────────────────
5. Although x/y and 3/4 are commonly used to denote division,
there may be little agreement about the meanings of x/y/z and
xy/z and x/yz, because they depend on the order of execution
in the phrases.

Since 3/4 is also used to denote the fraction (or rational)
three-quarters (as in the phrase "a 3/4 inch drill") the
phrases 3/4/z and x/3/4 raise further questions, because a
fraction 3/4 must be so interpreted before any division takes
place.
)

── ((6) 14 of 16) Puzzle 5 (ctd) ────────────────────────────
The treatment of rationals may be clarified by using 3r4 to
denote the rational three-quarters. For example:

The definitions of sin (1&o.) and cos (2&o.) suggests that
they are just two of several possible monadic functions
derived from the dyadic function o.

You may test this by entering the plots of some of the other
cases listed below:

plot x2 for 3&o. x2 NB. Tangent function

plot x2 for 4&o. x2

plot x2 for 5&o. x2 NB. Hyperbolic sine
