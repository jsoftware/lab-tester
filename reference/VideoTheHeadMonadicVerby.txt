Lab: Video - The Head Monadic Verb - {.y

Chapter: Video Requirements
 
_______________________________________

To run this video lab, you must have
access to youtube.com through the
internet.

If you do not, the lab will still
advance through the exercises, but the
videos will not be displayed.

Videos will appear as steps in the lab,
but you will need to click play on the video
to get it started.

When you have viewed a video, click back on
the terminal window to continue the lab.

This is required because when you are
interacting with a video, you are not
actually interacting with the J lab.

Now to prepare for the video

_______________________________________

Now, a chance to play with some of these
concepts and see if the results of these
examples meet your expectations.
_______________________________________
 
   [ A23 =. i. 2  3
0 1 2
3 4 5
 
   $ A23
2 3
 
Can you predict the result of
{. A23 and $ {. A23 ?
 
   {. A23  NB. The first item is a row of length 3
0 1 2
   $ {. A23
3
 
_______________________________________

Pretty much makes sense that the first
item of a shape of 2 3 will have a
shape of 3.

Remember that we create a one item list
using 1 {. A23 and then take the first
item from that list using 0 { 1 {. A23

Now, let's try another one.
_______________________________________
 
   [ A4 =. i. 4
0 1 2 3
 
   $ A4
4
 
Can you predict the result of
{. A4 and $ {. A4 ?
 
   {. A4
0
   $ {. A4 NB. Atoms have empty shape
 
_______________________________________

The shape of the first item is empty
because the first item of a rank one
array with shape 4 is an atom.

What if we had a list of length 1?
_______________________________________
 
   [ A1 =. ,4
4
 
   $ A1
1
 
Can you predict the result of
{. A1 and $ {. A1 ?
 
   {. A1
4
   $ {. A1 NB. Atoms have empty shape
 
_______________________________________

Even if it is a list of length one,
1 {. A1 will still create a list of
length one and the first item of that
list will be an atom with an empty shape.

Play around a bit more until you are
comfortable with these results or
any others that you might invent. You are
working in a fully functioning J
environment.

When you are satisfied, advance the
lab and get ready for the next video
which covers the case of empty shapes.

_______________________________________

Now we have looked at a number of
different empty arrays, so we probably
don't have to go over the examples you
have just seen, but feel free to on
your own time if you wish. I'll define
a few for your benefit.
_______________________________________
 
   [ A0 =. 0 $ 4
   [ A02 =. 0 2 $ 4
   [ A20 =. 2 0 $ 4


 
_______________________________________

What is more interesting is whether we
can tell if the fills have taken place
even if there is no visible result.

What about A010=. 0 1 0 $ 4

We know that the result was an empty line,
but is there any way to know if a fill was
ever used?

As a matter of fact there is, if we use the
fit conjunction (!.) which specifies the fill
that is used if required.
_______________________________________
 
   [ A010=. 0 1 0 $ 4
   datatype A010 NB. Integer as expected because the 'empty' content is 4.
integer
   {. A010 NB. Returns an empty line as expected.
   $ {. A010 NB. The shape of the first item is 1 0 as expected.
1 0
   datatype {. A010 NB. Integer as expected.
integer
 
_______________________________________

But if we force a fill of a different type,
then we can see if the type changes.

We do this using the Fit Conjunction !.

{.(!.a:) is a new verb based on {.
where !. forces the fill (if required)
to be an empty box - a:
_______________________________________
 
   {.(!.a:) A010 NB. Returns an empty line, as before
   datatype {.(!.a:) A010 NB. But now the type has changed, so fill was used even if we could not see it!
boxed
 
Well, that pretty much wraps up this lab,
except for a list of references where you
can find out more in depth information about
what you have seen.
